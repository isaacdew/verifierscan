# PS
I built this a few years back with the idea that we could build a tool that could reliably determine the credibility of a site. Obviously, this tool is quite primitive and does not quite accomplish that goal but I do hope that something that does will be developed. I think that such a tool could only have a chance of success if it is built by the open source community. Otherwise, there's so much room for accusations of bias. While an injection of bias is inevitable, a community of people from diverse backgrounds working on such a project would make it less of an issue.

Also, don't judge me too hard for the terrible code. It was awhile back and I've learned a lot since :D
